The **Post Management API** is a high-performance, production-ready RESTful service designed for social media data management. Built with the **FastAPI** framework, this project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern backend engineering, including asynchronous programming, complex relational database logic, and high-entropy cryptographic security.

## Core Engineering Principles

The architecture of this application is founded on four pillars of modern software engineering: type safety, stateless security, persistent versioning, and environment parity.

### 1. High-Performance Asynchronous Design

The system is built using an **Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)** pattern. By leveraging Python’s `asyncio` through the **Uvicorn** server, the API handles high-concurrency workloads without blocking execution threads.

* **Data Validation**: Utilizing **Pydantic**, the API enforces strict schema-based validation. Every request is checked before processing, ensuring that application logic never receives malformed data.
* **Serialization**: The system automatically converts complex database models including aggregated vote counts into clean JSON responses.

### 2. Advanced Security and Identity Management

Security is not an afterthought but a core component of the system’s design.

* **Cryptographic Hashing**: User credentials are protected using **Argon2** via `passlib`. As the winner of the Password Hashing Competition, Argon2 provides strong resistance against GPU-based attacks.
* **Stateless Authentication**: The API uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, allowing the server to remain stateless and horizontally scalable across multiple cloud instances.
* **Authorization Scoping**: Every request enforces strict ownership checks by validating the authenticated user’s ID against the resource `owner_id` directly at the database query level.

### 3. Database Evolution and Relational Logic

The application uses **SQLAlchemy** as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) with a **PostgreSQL** backend.

* **Relational Schema**: The system models users, posts, and votes. Voting behavior is implemented using a composite key table to simulate a many-to-many relationship.
* **Voting Logic**: The API supports upvoting and downvoting while preventing duplicate votes through database constraints and application logic.
* **Schema Versioning**: **Alembic** manages database migrations, allowing incremental schema updates such as introducing the voting system without data loss.
* **Referential Integrity**: The schema enforces `ON DELETE CASCADE`. When a user deletes their account, all related posts and votes are automatically removed.

## Tool Documentation and Usage

### Authentication and User Management

* **User Registration**: Create an account via the `/users` endpoint. Passwords are automatically hashed using Argon2 before storage.
* **JWT Login**: Submit credentials to the `/login` endpoint to receive a Bearer Token. This token must be included in the `Authorization` header for all protected routes.

### Post Orchestration and Interaction

* **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete support for posts.
* **Voting System**: Interact with content via the `/vote` endpoint:
  * `dir=1` adds a vote
  * `dir=0` removes a previously cast vote

## Implementation and Deployment

### Environment Setup

The system relies on a `.env` file to manage sensitive configurations, following the **Twelve-Factor App** methodology.

* DATABASE_HOSTNAME=your_host
* DATABASE_PORT=5432
* DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
* DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name
* DATABASE_USERNAME=your_user
* SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
* ALGORITHM=HS256
* ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
* git clone https://github.com/khallaftaha-cmyk/Post_Management_API
* cd Post_Management_API

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
* python -m venv venv
* source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
* pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Apply database migrations:
* alembic upgrade head

5. Start the application:
* uvicorn app.main:app --reload
